# Architecture

## Components
Here’s a high-level overview of the components within Lyra.

<p align="center"><img src="media/architecture.png" alt="architecture"></p>

### Manifests

A manifest will typically consist of one workflow definition written in a declarative or compiled language of choice. That workflow defines the desired state of an infrastructure or piece of an infrastructure.

### Languages

The currently supported languages are Puppet and Go. Manifests written in Go must be compiled and provided as a service.

### CLI

The Lyra Command Line Interface. Provides commands like *apply*, *validate*, and *version.*

### Workflow Engine

Performs evaluation of workflow activity definitions using services. Services and definitions are obtained from the *Loader*.

### Loader

Loads and manages all services, workflow activities, value types, and functions available to the system.

### Language Front-end

Parses workflow manifests written in a specific language into activity definitions that the workflow engine can understand. Executes imperative activities on demand using an evaluator native to the language.

### Lookup

A Hiera 5 compatible framework for looking up various values such as environment settings, command line options, secret credentials, and configuration values. A workflow or an activity can declare that input should be fulfilled by lookup.

The lookup framework is easy to extend with new functionality by adding special backend functions tailored to read from a file or use vault, k8s, etc.

### Identity Storage

A persistent store that maps Lyra internal activity identifiers to external resource identifiers.

### Service

An external process described by a service definition. Examples of services are:

* **Identity** - The Identity Storage

* **Puppet-Workflow** - Language Front-end for Puppet. Produces activity definitions from Puppet manifests

## Principles

### Dynamically Typed Values

The Lyra architecture relies heavily on dynamically typed values. A dynamically typed value can hold data of any kind and is described using a dynamic type. Important features of dynamically typed values are:

* Efficiently serialized/deserialized without loss of type information.

* Reflection to and from Go values.

* Readable string representation.

* Well defined comparison and arithmetic.

* Type assertion. Enables checks for type correctness.

* Reflective API.

* Unified way for accessing properties and invoking methods.

* Immutability, which eliminates a lot of potential concurrency problems.


The Type system used in Lyra is the same as in Puppet. This vouches for future integrations that communicate using complex data types (RichData).

### Federated Loaders

The Loader framework provided by the *puppet-evaluator* is used to form a loader hierarchy in Lyra. The basic loader hierarchy provided by the evaluator finds the all the well-known types such as *String*, *Integer*, *Array*, etc. It also allows for new types and functions to be added. Lyra then adds a customized loader that finds services and definitions.

Lyra performs a pre-load step where all services within reach are loaded and queried for what definitions they provide. This information is cached and made available to the CLI and the Workflow Engine. When a user enters an *apply* command with the name of a manifest, Lyra will find that manifest using its loader hierarchy.

### Serialization

The ability to send complex data structures between processes is very important to Lyra since much of its tasks are performed using services. All communication with such services are currently based on [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) over [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). The evaluator provides efficient bi-directional conversion between dynamically typed values and the Data protocol buffer provided by the Lyra *data-protobuf *module, enabling data of arbitrary complexity to be sent over the wire in a type-safe and efficient manner.

### Declarative or Imperative Programming

Lyra covers both programming models by providing specializations of an Activity, such as Resource, which is pure declaration of a desired state.

Lyra also allows generic activities that are very similar to functions. I.e. code that is called with parameters and returns values. Such activities can do virtually anything. When controlled by Guards they can mimic state-changes that are not easily expressed using resources.

### Ordering

Lyra makes ordering easy without enforcing a specific model onto the user. As mentioned, all order of execution can be determined by the workflow engine, either by just looking at the input and output declarations of activities contained in a workflow, or by running all activities sequentially.

Order isn’t applicable within individual activities because they are either a declaration of state, a block of code to execute, or a workflow in which case it manages its own order internally. If it is code, then that code is in charge of its own actions. The workflow engine treats an invocation of the code as one-off execution of something opaque.

A special iteration construct enables the declaration of an activity that should be invoked multiple times. The declared activity will run multiple times, each time with a different value of a given variable. The invocations will happen in parallel. Lyra has several iteration methods, including "times", “range”, “each”, and “each_pair”.

### CRUD

Read/Upsert/Delete are distinct functions that Lyra aims to provide out of the box. In many cases, all of them can be performed using one single workflow that declares a set of resources and a set of sane rules. As a starting point, we can define:

* Read - collect data and optionally report diffs between the desired and actual state.

* Upsert - create resource if it doesn't exist, otherwise ensure desired state.

* Delete - delete resources in the reverse order that they were created.

It is expected that more elaborate schemes will be architected and implemented. There will however still be cases where automated rules do not apply. In Lyra, this is solved by writing special workflows for the non-default situations.

## Go Modules

Lyra is built using Go modules. The suite of repositories it uses can be found at the [Lyra Project at GitHub](https://github.com/lyraproj). Here’s a brief description of each module (a module maps 1-1 to git a repository).

### lyra

Contains the Lyra CLI, Lyra Loader, and a suite of resource handlers.

### wfe

The Workflow Engine.

### puppet-workflow

The Puppet Language Front-end

### servicesdk

Lyra Software Development Kit. Intended for authors of new Lyra services. It provides what’s needed to register new services, handles, definitions, and types to the Go author. An sdk will be provided for each of the supported languages.

### hiera

A system used to lookup data from various sources such as yaml files, environment variables, or databases. This module is under development and provides only simple features using a hard-coded configuration. The goal is to provide functionality very similar to Hiera 5.

### puppet-evaluator

The Lyra Evaluator. Manages the Puppet Type System, dynamic typed values, Puppet compatible serialization of RichData, and evaluation of ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees) produced by the Puppet Parser.

### puppet-parser

Parser used when parsing types and manifests. The parser is a full implementation of the Puppet DSL.

### semver

An implementation of semantic version and version ranges. The implementation follows  the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/) for versions and the [Npm Version Range Specification](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver) for version ranges.

### issue

Formalized Warning and Error reporting.

### data-protobuf

Protobuf definition for transferring generic Data structures.

### puppet-spec

Contains lots of tests written in Puppet Spec language for parser, evaluator, and hiera modules.
