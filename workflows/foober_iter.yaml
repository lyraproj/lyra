# Foobernetes is an imaginary cloud provider used to illustrate and test the capabilities of Lyra.
#
# This file defines a workflow called "foober_iter" (which must be in a file of the
# same name). The workflow contains a set of interrelated activities and Lyra will
# determine the correct order in which to execute them based on the inputs and
# outputs of each. In this example we are deploying a (fictional) 3-tier application
# consisting of a database, two application servers and two web servers, with a load
# balancer in front. The fictional real-world resources are written to a file called
# "deployment.json" allowing you to see the changes made by Lyra.
#
# Try the following:
# 1. Use Lyra to apply the workflow:
#    "lyra apply --debug foober_iter"
# 2. Look at the debug output and compare with the newly-created "deployment.json"
#    file to see what Lyra has done.
# 3. Run Lyra a second time and note that no changes are made - all resources are
#    already in the desired state.
# 4. Edit the workflow then run Lyra again to see what happens.
# 5. Finally, use Lyra to delete all deployed resources:
#    "lyra delete --debug foober_iter"
#
# This example is written in yaml. See the yaml documentation here: docs/workflow-yaml.md
foober_iter:

  # Typespaces are namespaces. Here we define the default typespace for
  # this workflow, which allows us to omit it in some cases below.
  # See "loadbalancer" for an example.
  typespace: Foobernetes

  # The workflow expects a single value as input. The input is named
  # "load_balancer_policy" and is used in the "loadbalancers" iteration activity below.
  # The value itself comes from the "data.yaml" file at runtime based on the
  # "lookup" key specified here: in this case a key called "lb_policy" nested in
  # the "foober_iter" section. All top-level workflow inputs must be specified in
  # the "data.yaml" file at runtime.
  input:
    load_balancer_policy:
      type: String
      lookup: foobernetes.lb_policy

  # The workflow produces two output values: the IDs produced by the
  # "loadBalancers" iterator activity. All top-level workflow outputs must be outputs of
  # activities within this workflow.
  output: loadbalancers

  # Activities are the main body of the workflow and define its behavior. The
  # ordering of the activities is not important - Lyra will infer the correct
  # order in which to execute the activities based on their inputs and outputs.
  #
  # The activities in this workflow are all declarative "stateful activities",
  # meaning they define the desired states of real-world resources. For each type
  # of stateful activity, there is a "state handler" that takes responsibility for
  # ensuring the real-world resource matches the desired state. It does this by
  # creating, reading, updating or deleting those resources in response to
  # workflow changes. The types and state handlers for this workflow are defined
  # in Go and can be found in the "go-foobernetes" plugin.
  #
  # Although Lyra support imperative "stateless activities", it is not possible to
  # specify these in yaml.
  #
  # In yaml, activity inputs are usually implicit (though can be made explicit if
  # desired) and any field value that starts with a dollar sign ($) is assumed to
  # be an input e.g. $databaseID. Activity outputs are always explicit. An
  # activity can only be executed when all inputs are available. Those inputs must
  # come from either the top-level workflow inputs or the outputs of other
  # activities. Inputs and outputs are correlated by name and so must be unique
  # within a workflow.
  activities:

    # This activity defines an iteration activity called "webServers" which will
    # create two identical "Foobernetes::Webserver" resources. The type is explicit.
    # Since this is an iteration, there is a single list output named "webServers"
    # containing values of the "webServerID" field declared in the "output" section.
    # The "webServerID" field is present in the actual state of the resource returned
    # by the "webserver" state handler. The input is implicit and can be identified by
    # the use of a dollar sign ($) i.e. appServers.
    webServers:
      type: Foobernetes::Webserver
      output: webServerID
      iteration:
        function: times

      state:
        port: 8080
        appServers: $appServers

    # This iteration activity iterates over an array of 3 element arrays. Each iteration
    # assigns the 3 values to their corresponding variables $role, $ip, and $replica which
    # are then used when declaring each loadbalancer's state.
