## What is Lyra?

Lyra (“lee-ruh”) is an open source workflow engine for provisioning and managing cloud native infrastructure. Using infrastructure as code, Lyra enables you to declaratively provision and manage public cloud, private cloud, and any API-requested resources as well as orchestrate imperative actions upon them.

Infrastructure management involves defining and executing workflows that manage the underlying resources across their entire lifecycle - performing the initial provisioning, orchestrating intentional changes, and ultimately decommissioning those resources. Lyra is built to help manage all of these types of these workflows.

A Lyra Workflow describes a collection of Activities in a single manifest. An Activity is a declarative resource or imperative action that can be orchestrated together. These include API-requested resources such as Azure Functions, Kubernetes Deployments, and Datadog monitors, as well as imperative actions and scripts. Lyra keeps a record of the resources that Lyra has provisioned in order to ensure idempotency.

Lyra provides a number of language bindings to describe a Workflow, and the workflow engine is decoupled from the language bindings so that other language front-ends can be added to the system.  The first such language binding is Puppet, a popular desired-state configuration language for defining infrastructure-as-code. Other language bindings are being developed, including YAML and TypeScript.

Lyra enables teams to create organization-specific infrastructure Workflows that others can consume in a self-service way.  Lyra is built  to integrate into multiple familiar developer user interfaces, starting with a Kubernetes custom resource definition and controller, and as well as  CI/CD Pipeline and CLI interfaces (coming soon!).

A Workflow can be packaged as a deployable unit and consumed from any of these interfaces. By separating the authoring of the Workflows from their consumption, Lyra enables Application Services teams to provide tested configurations, embedded governance policies, and security validated policies in a single, deployable artifact that Application Developers can provision as dependencies within their containerized application.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the git repo: `$ git clone https://github.com/lyraproj/lyra`
2. Build the binary: `$ cd lyra; make lyra`
3. Run the binary with the sample Workflow: ` $ ./build/lyra --debug apply sample`

(You can view the sample Workflow that is applied by the command above in `plugins/example.pp`.  There is also an AWS Workflow called `attach` in `plugins\attach.pp`.  This will use the default AWS region configured in `~/aws/config` and create real AWS resources.  The `data.yaml` file can be used to configure AWS tag data)

## Integrating with Kubernetes
1. Install the Lyra CRD as described in the [lyra-operator](https://github.com/lyraproj/lyra-operator/blob/master/README.md) repo
2. Start Lyra in controller mode: ` $ ./build/lyra --debug controller`
3. Create a Workflow resource, also described in the [lyra-operator](https://github.com/lyraproj/lyra-operator/blob/master/README.md) repo

## Project Status
Very much in early development. Lyra is just starting and things are a bit bumpy! Star this project above to stay tuned.

## Roadmap
Here’s a proposed roadmap for the project. Given the infancy of the project, it will change over time. We see the Lyra roadmap evolving in the following three dimensions:

### User Experience
- [ ] Core Engine (minimal CLI)
	- [x] Apply
	- [ ] Destroy
- [x] Kubernetes custom resource definition/controller
- [ ] Full CLI (with preview functionality)
- [ ] GitOps

### Language Support
- [x] Puppet
- [ ] YAML
- [ ] TypeScript
- [ ] Language X (File a [feature request](https://github.com/lyraproj/lyra/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)!)

### Content Ecosystem
- [x] Proof of concept
- [ ] Public cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- [ ] Provider X ecosystem (File a [feature request](https://github.com/lyraproj/lyra/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)!)

## Releases
### Proof of Concept - TODAY
* Ability to express resources in a Workflow in Puppet language

### Release 0.1
* Ability to apply these resources with a single provider (AWS)
* Ability to package a Workflow
* Ability to expose Workflows as Kubernetes resources
* Ability to destroy resources

### Release 0.2
* Preliminary providers for AWS, Azure, GCP with minimal resources
* Support for YAML
* Expanded content
